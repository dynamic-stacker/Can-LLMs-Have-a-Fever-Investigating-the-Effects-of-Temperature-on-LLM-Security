# Investigating the effects of temperature on jailbreaking of LLM models

This project contains all the codes for running of the experiments including data processing and cleaning of open-sourced LLMs. It also contains the code for running tests on ChatGPT for benchmarking of the open-sourced LLMs.


It is recommended that you run one model at a time, 1A first, then 1B, then 2A then 2B.
However, for the same model, you are also recommended to run all the temperatures at the same time.
Do note that the file names depend on the temperature, so be careful to not overwrite data unintentionally.


There are some duplicate files for 2B where you can process the data at the same time, just remember to change the variables and read the comments in the individual code files before running.
